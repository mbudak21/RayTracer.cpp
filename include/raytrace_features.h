/* 
Usage:
    Include this file in any project file that requires compilation-based control of features.
    If you wrap code related to the feature in an #if defined(FEATURE) block, 
    you can turn the feature on and off by changing the state of the define.
    
Example:   
    #if defined(AMBIENT_LIGHTING)
        col += ambient;
    #endif
    #if defined(DIFFUSE_LIGHTING)
        col += diffuse;
    #endif
    #if defined(SPECULAR_LIGHTING)
        col += specular;
    #endif
